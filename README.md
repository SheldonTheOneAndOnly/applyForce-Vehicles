# applyForce Vehicles
About
--
This is a collection of Garry's Mod vehicles made with Expression 2's *applyForce*. Instead of using **thrusters and wheels** (which can cause problems), it uses applyForce as a thruster. Like the thruster, it goes slower if the mass if bigger, but unlike the thruster, *the entity itself is the thruster*, meaning that it's thrusting *itself*, and that could (maybe) improve aerodynamics and movements.
